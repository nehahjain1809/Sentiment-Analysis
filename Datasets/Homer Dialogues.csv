bart its not like im asking you to give blood for free that would be crazy youre a little young to understand this but when you save a rich mans life he showers you with riches dont you know the story of hercules and the lion
yeah probably anyway once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw and all the village people tried to pull it out but nobody was strong enough so they got hercules and hercules used his mighty strength and bingo anyway the moral is the lion was so happy he gave hercules this big thing of riches
it was the olden days

marge someones squeezed all the life out of these kids and unless movies and tv have lied to me its a crusty bitter old dean
boy i cant wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt
hold me
you see that sir drops his notes
do we have to
then kiss my curvy butt goodbye

i dont have time to read just give me the gist of it son
your kid flew five feet that counts as a ride two bucks
look at this marge fifty-eight dollars and all of it profit im the smartest businessman in the world
marge please dont humiliate me in front of the money
um milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once right
well that was under our old price structure under our new price structure your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars now youve already paid me four dollars so thats just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me
this town is full of deadbeats we cant afford this elephant
sorry bart im gonna have to sell him
what do you mean its an elephant isnt it
he likes peanuts
i only have two questions how much and give it to me
so your bid is zero
thank you

oh i see youre having a party ill come back later
oh all right maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong
all we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage mir
no
hike
oh i shoulda punted turn it off turn it off

stupid movies who invented these dumb things anyway was it you bart
no one man can do all that youre a liar honey a dirty rotten liar
really a restaurant well now i dont know what to think
cut it out boy
reading about this edison character they wont let me in the big people library downtown there was some unpleasantness i can never go back
ooh look at all the inventions edison came up with the stock ticker the storage battery even wax paper and look at him dance
de de de de de
and these hardy boys books are great too this one is about smugglers
no not this one the smugglers of pirate cove its about pirates
i think its pretty obvious that i am
go school
not the way i quit ooh-who
yeah yeah yeah yeah great story lenny but heres one thats even more spellbinding once upon a time there was a man named thomas edison and he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph
and he was a firm believer in fletcherism and he played the organ and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh and his middle name was alva and he never ever ever wore pajamas and
well i remember where edison worked it was menlo park thats where he came up with the tasimeter the ore separator and
thats boring youre boring everybody quit boring everyone
and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead some kind of scary telephone i guess or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell
ohh thats where youre wrong marge he was a shameless self-promoter
marge thats it thats why i havent done anything with my life i need to be more like thomas edison
and im starting right now no more lousy pajamas
from this day forward i am an inventor
well i quit my job just like you said to
yes you did i remember your exact words you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or youd torch the house
at my age edison had already invented 203 things ohh ive got a lot of work to do to catch up to him
lets see now inventions inventions
what eh eh let me handle the creative end of this marge you dont understand how the creative mind works like i do
you look at this table and what do you see just a table now a creative person like me looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables
my files
uh this isnt working ive got to try a different approach


yes thomas edison smoked several cigars a day
shutup

as long as youre here annoying me lets have a brainstorming session now heres how it works lisa you say one thing then bart you say another just toss out things and ill use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea
okay
uh-huh
a-- wait a minute these arent exciting new products youre not even trying okay thats it both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves
i dont see why not theyre my kids i own em
okay we own em
ohhh its no use i cant work like this cut off from the scientific community
you stay here and guard the sandwich
look i just want to know how to invent things tell me
you mean like an electric blanketmobile
hamburger earmuffs
thanks sucker
okay i have here the four greatest inventions in the history of mankind
first my all-purpose electric hammer for all your pounding needs
ow
probably needs to be more powerful
now heres my everythings okay alarm
this will sound every three seconds unless something isnt okay
it cant be turned off
but it does break easily now this next ones for the ladies how many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting only to realize youre not wearing makeup
thats why i invented this revolutionary makeup gun its for the woman who only has four-fifths of a second to get ready close your eyes marge
and now youre ready for a night on the town
eh oh okay this time try to keep your nostrils closed
oh look what you did now i have to get my cold cream gun
women will like what i tell them to like now heres something for everyone
in the olden times if you were watching tv and nature called youd have to get up and walk to the bathroom it was the hardest thing in the world to do but now with the lazy man reclining toilet chair you can just lean back and let er rip
sure believe me every man in america will want to have one
yes
yes yes yes
what
but this is the best i could do i guess im no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson
all week my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison but now its over i guess ill just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father

oh that i stuck a couple of extra legs on there cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff
really you think its a good idea
i did it im gonna be rich
look mr edison i did it im an inventor and i owe it all to you
see its just a regular chair but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back kinda like the ones on the back of your
awdammit
i thought i had a great idea but i mustve seen it on this poster
its not maybe he never told anyone about it
that chair might be the only one he made
so weve got to go to the edison museum and smash it then ill be an inventor
aw to hell with him
taking-bart-across-state-lines-back-soon
i borrowed your wallet
oh son youre young and headstrong just like thomas edison jr you know he started a mushroom farm and an auto parts company and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company oh and later he raised turkeys that was on his turkey farm
now lets take care of business
outta the way this is one invention youre not getting credit for you inspiration hog
invent your way out of this edison
look son edison was just like me
no we both lived in another mans shadow this old-timey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache
were not rivals were just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high i cant destroy your work my friend
no but well stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home

what plan
marge put so much work into that party the least i could do is be surprised if only i could forget what happened today

for the love of god make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce
and when you pushed me off the bridge its cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here

things happened between your mother and me that were not proud of it was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties
oh it was a wonderful time the iraq war was over once and for all a struggling matt groening created futurama and young people believed in their dreams thanks to a tv show called melrose place
your mother and i were dating and we had just moved into our first apartment together
we didnt have a lot of money but we were young and in love
like all young people i had a musical dream
a dream called inoffensive urban light hip-hop smooth grooves
but marges education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world
marge marge where are you
i was so depressed i spent all my time in a bar
i had finally realized every rock stars dream
hating being famous
a tale of two young outlaws in love

gentlemen to the troll twins of underbridge academy
so does this square us for kansas city
how could the publishers change our book if they had been in charge of the sistine chapel the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the popes private naked dude mural
but the trolls were the best part do the characters still say troll-y instead of cool
oh that is so untroll-y
british fonzie is right our story is actually more important than money
somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece
kansas city

please please rush into this please rush into this
in my house we found human bones
really im cool oh can i man-hug you
i dont know how
okay our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors ive already blown them away -- their words i assume -- so dont screw it up
great marge now thats in their heads
star wars chewys just a man in a costume so hes not scary
t-rex even their names are cool this is umm ice cream bungee jump and viral video
check out my new look
terence shaved my head
no im young person cool bald not old person sad bald i never want to see these again
check it out flanders us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard guess i cant be your best friend anymore
boo hoo hoo you can cry all night its not gonna win me back
i have a plan to deal with that step one change everything about ourselves until we are super cool the end
honey im not cool i was never cool i didnt go to college every cd i have i bought at a carwash black-and-white films make me angry i cant pronounce artis-anal i only know david cross from the chipmunks movie not only do i like van halen but i think they keep getting better
but if me and my kids do the same stuff as terence and his kids i could be a cool dad
thanks baby here have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip
no we need to take kids to grownup stuff thats terences parenting style--
well you wont be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches
wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool the essence
oh man my goatee has barely come in why does my hair only grow in twos
i hope t-rex likes the present i made him
homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are if i show up with a toy from the store like we would give our kids then ive failed and these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing
t-rex loves decaying industrial-scapes
i thought it made blimp tires
are we still on for midnight bike riding

oh ohhhh boy oh oh oh oh boy oh boy
o-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy we had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors and you had to screw it up

what no one judges my wifes thunderbags well maybe i was wrong about these people who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk
they can goatee hell
yeah thats right the friendship between the simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over
fine keep em but you have to give back lisa
could we at least agree to both hate flanders
shut up with your names
parenting let me tell you cool parents something parents are supposed to be lame so their kids have something to rebel against by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame its natures way
even flanders agrees this is our neighborhood we were here first so you should leave
oh no its true
stupid town at least ive still got moes although probably not seeing where this is going
what happened here
oh marge its bad
i brought these people to springfield and now theyve taken over
its a hellhole
what happened to our town everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future
okay you win we dont have to be friends but can we live on the fringes of your world like those eels that eat whale poop
your organic all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all
theyre necessary theyre necessary
theyre finally necessary
i did it i did it i man-hugged
well i cant pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt

oh no i wont be able to help you pack up grampa
hold down the fort with my bad back

whoa now ive gotta buy a corpse wagon thats how they getcha
its amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese

a minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me torture torture torture
he knows i love him and he loves me
thats short for rrright you are

okay okay ill be nicer to the dude ive just never really been a dog person
bongo i told you never to ever talk about bongo
ever
hes still my dog
i dont know what you just said but its wrong wrong wrong wrong
it doesnt make sense to me
i happen to remember it just a little differently
now granted i was just a kid but i say
everythings a flavor in the kitchens of today
grampa always hated bongo and loved money so he sold bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped santa so id never get the toy i actually wanted--
and then and then wha and then what happened what gee my story doesnt make much sense except the santa part
wait wait theres one part of the story even grampa didnt know about a few months later i went to rescue bongo
but there was one thing i wasnt prepared for
bongo was happy without me he had become her dog
well thats just the way dogs are the most disloyal unfaithful creatures god ever made
he still has my sweatshirt
oh my god dad i owe you an apology you saved bongo i never understood that till now
why would you think that just because i put you in a home where they feed you dog food
okay but im a little out of practice
what flavor
if it doesnt matter then i call snickers
my dog
yeah mom you promised
sorry mrs simpson
is this a kid youd pay ransom for
feed it to the dog
dont you tell me how to feed you to the dog
cant i keep an eye on that kid hes fabulous
its always my kids
whered they go

apes deep down were all savage apes leave your body homer
what the hell was that

i guess despite all our so-called civilization anarchy lurks around every corner like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show
america cant collapse were as powerful as ancient rome
sweet

oh my god this unsourced undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt
preppies oh i hate you guys always partying on deck with your docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge
its based on nothing
id slash my wrists but how without my electric knife
i cant conceive of any

dont worry i am very good at keeping secrets
impending doom

honey everythings fine theres nothing to worry about
just go play your saxophone while you can
secrets i have no secrets just enjoy this golden time you will soon cling desperately to the memory of smell some bread
typical sheeple
maybe
yeah but ill go home weigh myself and ill have gained six pounds whats that about
i guess an open garage isnt the best hiding place
i wish son the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies
so what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon
hollywood has taught you well my son now lets push play
fridge-ra-torr
do not question the wisdom of tom skerritt
wow your end of the world is better than my during the world
aw uh listen ive gotta know youre not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat
its okay i know what i am
um a lot of that stuff mustve got lost in the move
i want to tell you but i promised to keep it a secret
its very late in the marriage to tell me that
ive hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall
see these are our bug-out bags in here is everything we need to survive
the looming kablooey
creepy marge the apocalypse is coming maybe not tomorrow maybe never but its coming and soon
theres no handle on this side
the one thing i couldnt prepare for
marge this is it teotwawki
uh-huh wheres the kids
boy get in the car and say goodbye to your best friend forever
this is my daughter she brings the gift of music to the new world
baritone
heres something to pass the endless time write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations
society will not have to start from square one
marge when i started prepping for the end of the world everyone laughed at me
well just because i imagined it doesnt make it any less true and now all those people are on their own
if jesus had a gun hed be alive today

why do we have to shoot them at all
no i want to help the people who didnt prepare
dont be silly mary ellen
now were going to leave this place im sorry bart -- i know youve made a bug-out camp girlfriend
white rice or brown
so well take these supplies back to springfield where theyre needed most
hm i cut the wires to something
okay everybody keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something if we miss it were dead
how can that be i took every last can of gas
now everyone relax and pretend were about to be hit by a soft brick wall
out of our way corn the starving people of springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn corn flakes and flash frozen corn nibblets
now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy starvation and having sex for procreation

you got to watch a vhs copy of red dawn thirteen times stop complaining
we can keep the shrimp de-veiner though right
good riddance when i found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol i really lost interest

kids theres nothing to worry aboutbut were looking at replacements for your mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family

like all childless couples they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young
oh yeah man
dont worry marge well get em unless we die on this icy mountain road then theyve won forever
women and their horrible thoughts
marge let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids but those kids are ours because we made them by accident and now were gonna take them back because we love them especially now that weve had a little time apart from them
ive got a bone to pick with you then an apology to make then we exchange insurance information then more bone picking
those better be good breaks
sure you wanted the fun parts but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals
well im glad someone has
weve won woo hoo
instead of concentrating on dying were going to concentrate on living
why you little
i do call this living living the way kids in india can only dream of
i win
i forget
ladies please you can boss me around just one at a time
what the
finally a supervisor
thank god i wore the underwear with the hole on the side
if youre lucky me then this
listen to your sister boy
what are you talkin about marge and i are goin great
it was during happy hour dont you want our baby to be happy
how can something that applies to bart apply to me im so much older and wiser
why you little ill teach you to say something that sounds similar
you told me it was up to me if i wanted to go
i am sick and tired of trying to decode you like youre some kind of human being separate from myself
finally were gettin somewhere
hand me my suitcase boy
when youre older
youre saying it like it happens all the time and by the way the paints a little faded on my parking spot you call this a platinum club experience
ive told you a thousand times call me homer
standard hotel boilerplate it just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours
oh itll happen again son
knock yourself out
not again
i had this idea years agobut your mother wouldnt let me do it
shows how much she knooooows its hurting my eyes
you know what we need a classic kicked outta the house party now whos got a rockin cd
thats it well then lets power this party up
this calls for decisive action -- like lbjs use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the civil rights act
the same way hollywood does by watching british movies
agreed but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture
after we finish watching the movie
i wrote this song to say im sorry
the melody is by beethoven
marge you will get the last pork chop
and i promise to do the things i checked off within a year
i think its a terence malick movie
finally a kids show that isnt trying to sell you something which reminds me we need to order more rectangles
honey this sounds like a noble experiment but like prohibition it will end in a hail of bullets
im on it
if i buy you why do i need all these books
spot the hidden objects
boy youre pretty pushy for a book i just met
gotcha candy cane in the umbrella stand -- oldest trick in the book okay lets see
if theyre not a trumpet or a rolling pin then no
okay now to see if i can apply my book knowledge to the real world

your hair is growing back tell me your secret
theres always a catch
its gonna be yes but dont rush me
son promise you will never look like me
why you little thats not a heartwarming thing to end on
i cant believe youre reading when theres so much great stuff on tv
writing is for bathroom walls and acting is for getting out of duis the only reason tv exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human made-up jobs

well we wont know that till after
but how can we learn to read ancient icelandic
yes
forvitinn
you cant not do it
okay lets see what this thing says
when the barbarian invaders came the carlsons met them with their weapons ready
weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender the carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking the lootingand the volcano-ing of the village elders
the carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice
carls family was even worse than people thought
yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d
attention everyone in iceland we have an important announcement
is this everyone
ive learned something about the people of iceland youve endured barbarian invasions total financial collapse and a lesbian prime minister
youve managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs and to do that you have to be stubborn
but i ask you to put aside your stubbornness while i tell you about carl carlson
it doesnt matter what happened a thousand years ago for carl carlsons honor has been redeemed by the deeds of carl carlson
and when he brings a six-pack to my house he doesnt take the extras home with him carl carlson leaves them in the fridge
aww thanks flanders gotta warn ya he doesnt talk much

hey man can i bum a tent
hey marge
we got a new tent from a guy who odd

just like i planned
i understand i already signed up for this place next year i gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude

ill take those
beware the butterflys sting what the
and thats the terrifying tale of how the quebec nordiques became the colorado avalanche
lisa how many times have i told you to bow down to our corporate overlords
its like some kind of guitar central
stig youve got a name thats not a name
oh i dont have what it takes to play guitar i mean im no joe walsh in the brains department
what the rock
i did a lick
oh my god im amazing
im not set at all
this is embarrassing to admit stig but i hadnt even thought about gels
music beautiful music
beautiful music baby
sure it is you know ive always loved laying things down grooves are just the latest
i feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players like whats his name from the who or that guy from led zeppelin who wasnt page plant or bonham those are the only two i know for sure
oh yeah and you know whats the great thing is about music its so easy
so easy
i dont know guys im not sure im feeling this the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument
i almost forgot the most important thing
great practice guys what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day
oh yeah apu im sure youre a great singer but the balance of the band is really delicate right now and were not really looking for a world music vibe no disrespect to world music i love world music
that sounds nothing like terrible terrible world music
guys are you feeling this are you feeling this
we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families we are now a cover band and we shall be called covercraft because we play covers and this is our craft
that was not my intent okay covercraft hands in
cover
r o k c
okay this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new
apu whats wrong
i still want one
buddy buddy think of it this way youre not singing in front of all those people youre alone at the kwik-e-mart in the middle of the night you just wear this on stage and everything will be fine
well son i do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write down the names of and then cover but then i remember im just a regular guy jamming with my buds
yep its all about the music and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that pretty unforeseen
guys i really need your honesty here at the squidport senior jamboree was i too in the pocket
how
what kind of erotic asphyxiation
oh
i think i can answer for apu hes flattered but the small-time success of covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted
apu has a rich life here in springfield a store full of great products a lovely him-type wife and eight super kids anoop sandeep nabendu gheet pria uma poonam sashi--
not me im nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune
i want his fame and fortune so much why must the lords of rock be so cruel
sammy hagar youre not dead
its something you make sketches about
im not jealous im envious jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have envy is wanting what someone else has what i feel is envy
you know what apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band were gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left
phil collins-era genesis is not as good huh no reply at all land of confusion throwing it all away illegal alien i cant dance and im sure i dont need to mention invisible touch
what so you can also get famous and bail on us youre out of the band
oh so youre sticking up for yoko here looks like ive got another yoko on my hands
yoko yoko yoko yoko yoko all you yokos are out of the band
do i sound okay
theyre not juicy my licks are dry dry and scratchy like a cats tongue
well its not enough anymore when something great happens to one person everyone elses life gets a little worse look it up its called physics
oh you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star
ill never have a per diem
apu wouldnt be able to sing a note if i didnt help him get over his stage fright with his kwik-e-mart shirt
backstage pass you just became a payback rage pass
look at all this rock star dressing room stuff what a sellout cheese plate -- oh sorry cubed cheese plate lemon tea probably for his throat
lets see how he performs in front of all those people without his magic-people-performing-in-front-of shirt

im sorry apu i thought you were living your dream life so naturally i wanted to ruin it but now i know things stink so im okay with it
kwik-e-mart hot dog eh
hopin hopin

oooh red hots
mmm these do taste better at the ballpark uh oh
i was graceful i was witty brother i was somethin
but they didnt care
it was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark
the only applause i got was for dragging my carcass out of there

my wife and kids stood by me on the way home i realized how little that helped
so thats it the costumes buried now as my son would say im one sad ape-like dude
